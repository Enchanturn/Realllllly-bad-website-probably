    <h1>Why Araquanid Is One Of The Most Tragic Pokemon</h1>
    <p>First, Araquanid has a really cool and unique design and ability, with water bubble halving the damage from fire type moves and protects it from burns, and has the hidden effect of doubling the power of water type moves. This means that it could be a hard counter to fire types or a really strong water type attacker. However, its limited moveset and frankly terrible stats and typeing hold it back severly. The bug typing being one of, if not the worst offensive and defensive typing, and even making it only have a normal resistance against fire as the bug type weaskness cancels out the water risistance. Also, Araquanid's movepool highly hold it back, as it dosen't even get the most basic physical water type moves like aqua jet or flip turn, heavily impacting its flexibility. Also, it gets almost no setup moves, it really needs at least something like swords dance, bulk up, or trailblaze. Next, lets talk about its stats. It has terrible stats, they really did it dirty, with a measly 70 in attack and 42 in sppeed, they put its highest stat as a 132 in special defence and a 92 in defence, which dosent really come into play as its typing, moveset, and hp completly remove the possibility of it being a tank. While it getting sticky webs and liquidation is a lucky break, it is not enough to redeem its viability.     </p>
    <p> Next, I will suggest what could recover this trash heap of a really cool pokemon. First, it needs to move like 10 points from special attack, 50 points from its special defence, and 20 points from its defence to move it to its attack and/or speed, and its is entirely plausible to add 50 more points to its base stat total and give them to its speed and/or attack as it would still be well within the range of  its couterparts from other generations. Next, give it trailblaze at least, as it makes sense based on what the move is doing and the fact that it is on multiple other pokemon where it makes much less sense. Also, giving it something like swords dance would be great and work about as well thematiclly as charizard or nincada getting it. Finnaly, it could also just get a mega evolution or a 3rd evolution, which could also fix its typing, possibly with the water around its head getting polluted and it changes as it evolves into a water poison type or maybe it gets a burst of energy and it turns into a water dragon type, althogh its more likely that these would change its water type or even design concept, which probably isn's what it needs, though it could also be cool for it to turn into an astronot dragon or something with its water bubble, and it helps that that gives it an 8x resistance to fire. these are my grivences with araquanid as it is now, and although it is a really cool design, at least some of these improvements should be made. </p>
